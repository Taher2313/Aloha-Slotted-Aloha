# Aloha & Slotted Aloha

The task involves simulating the unslotted/slotted aloha protocols in Python. The simulation involves N stations sharing the same medium, with each station having a probability P of sending a new frame at each timestamp. Frames take M units of time to transmit, and collisions result in retransmission after a random delay. The objective is to implement the protocols and evaluate their performance in terms of throughput and efficiency.

## Throughput vs Number of Stations
